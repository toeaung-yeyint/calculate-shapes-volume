# Project description

This app provides advice to users on when to increase or decrease the unit price of Mohinga based on various factors, including the peak selling period, the new financial year, and the presence of a financial crisis. Additionally, it generates a line chart to display suggested prices.

## Project specifications

- The app will simulate when users need to raise or drop a unit price of the food for months of the year in a line chart.
- “Calculate” button shouldn’t work until a user puts a value in every required input field.
- If a user enters a negative number or the number that is less than 0 for the input fields “Year, Retail price per unit (AUD)”, an error message will be displayed.
- If a user picks "Peak selling period" for the end month that is earlier than the start month, an error message will be displayed.
- Users can start a new calculation by clicking on the "New calculation" button.
- If a user clicks on the "New calculation" button, the chart will be gone and a user will go back to form.
