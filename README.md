# Project description

This app will allow users to determine whether to raise or lower the price of the food (Mohinga - traditional food of Burmese people) during specific times of the year in a line chart as well as checking the end of the year revenue and profits.


## Project specifications

- Users can simulate when they need to raise or drop the price of the food for specific times of the year in a line chart.
- “Calculate” button shouldn’t work until a user puts a value in every required input field.
- If a user enters a negative number or the number that is less than 0 for the input fields “Starting year, Starting capital, Retail price”, “Value must be greater than or equal to 0” will be displayed.
- Users can view end of the year revenue and end of the year profit after the calculation.
- If a user clicks on the “Rest” button, the result section and values in the input fields will be clear.
